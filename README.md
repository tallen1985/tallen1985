# Troy Allen // Web Developer
## About Me
  - Front end developer with a strong customer service background to fully realize the needs of clients on the web. 
  A recent graduate of UNH Full Stack Program with which I received a Certificate in Full Stack Web Development with 
  skills in Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, SQL and NoSQL database.  Recently I have analyzed and updated code in which 
  outdated non-semantic HTML language was taken out as well as reorganized and fixed errors in CSS3.  Before beginning 
  the UNH program, I created a personal website written in REACT as utilizing Web API protocols as well as creating 
  web applications utilizing Python, Flask, Express and Node.js.   In each project, I strive to utilize responsive dynamic 
  elements to create and maintain the most up to date web experience.  Iâ€™m looking forward to joining a team and contribute 
  my real life experiences to create truly memorable web presence.
